In various industries such as e-commerce, retail, fashion, design, and marketing, there is a need for an accurate and efficient method of identifying, categorizing, and recommending colours. Human subjectivity and inconsistency in colour perception, coupled with the time-consuming nature of manual colour analysis, hinder efficiency and creativity. 
For individuals with colour vision deficiencies, accurately identifying colours poses challenges. An AI colour analysis tool can bridge this gap by providing colour information in alternative formats like text descriptions or patterns, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility.
An AI colour analysis tool can analyze customer preferences and behaviours to provide tailored colour recommendations for products, thereby improving customer satisfaction and engagement.
